### Project Set Up Instructions



##### Unity Set Up

1. Make sure you have Unity installed. If you don't, download it from [Unity's website](https://unity.com/).
2. Open "Unity Hub" and navigate to the "Installs" tab.
3. Make sure you have version **6000.1.9f1** installed. If you don't, find and install it from the [Unity Download Archive](https://unity.com/releases/editor/archive).



##### Project/Repository Set Up

1. Download and set up your preferred Git tools/GUI. Some common ones include [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads), [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/), [TortoiseGit](https://tortoisegit.org/), or [Sourcetree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/).
2. On **this** GitHub repository, find the green "Code" button, click on the dropdown arrow, and copy the URL provided
3. Follow the instructions for your chosen GUI to clone a repository. They're all fairly straightforward, but if you get stuck, there are plenty of documents and tutorials out there
4. Before touching any project files, find the "CommitLog" file in the root of the repository folder, and add your name to the list
5. Commit this change with the name "\[YourName] initial commit" and push that commit to main. Again, there are a number of tutorials for this as well



And you should be all set! If you have any questions about set up or proper Git usage, find Ethan (@wheaton\_508) on The Verse's Discord server and either ping me or shoot me a DM. I'll try to answer as soon as possible. And don't be afraid to ask! Trust me - asking for help is a lot easier than accidentally messing something up and needing to tell me anyway.
